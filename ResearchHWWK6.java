	 * Research and write about the differences between Abstract Classes and Interfaces.
	 * 
	 *			Abstraction and as far as I understand abstraction it is a way to simplify things. 
	 *			Two main ways to go about this are through an Abstract Class and through an Interface. In an 
	 * 			Abstract Class, it has to be inherited and cannot be instantiated -I would use an interface when 
	 * 			my objects are already identified as to what they are - but I'm not quite sure
	 *			as to what that object will do in each instance. So I remember it in my head like this; 
	 *			I use an abstract class if A needs to be B and I use an interface if A needs to be capable of X. 
	 *	
	 * Research and write about why Unit Testing is important and what benefits it adds.
	 *		 
	 *			Unit Testing (which is denoted with @JUnit) are tests build to, well, put to the test the functionality
	 *			of each method you write. You'll focus on what the method is supposed to do, then work on 
	 *			fringe cases and examples of how your method might fail. While it is more time consuming and therefore
	 *			a more expensive practice, but it ensures sound code and speeds up the development cycle as well. 
	 *			It can be performed in 2 ways - manual testing and automated testing.  Automated is the preferred 
	 *			usually because they are programmable and usually more precise and accurate.
